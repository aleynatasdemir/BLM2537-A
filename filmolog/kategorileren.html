                            Until the birth year of true cinema with "The Jazz Singer," produced by Warner Bros in 1927, all films were shot without dialogues since the first film was recorded in 1895. This era, known as "Silent Cinema," presented dialogues from the script through intertitles, and all films were shown with musical accompaniment.

                            <font color="red"><b><h4>Many masterpieces were created during the silent cinema era</h4></b><br></font>
                            From Charlie Chaplin to Eisenstein, the silent cinema era, which began with pioneering works and played a significant role in turning cinema into an art form, witnessed the creation of many masterpieces across various genres, from westerns to comedies.
                
                            After inventing the "Cinematograph," a device combining a camera and projector, by the Lumiere brothers, film screenings, along with short films they shot, started in 1895.
                
                            The film "Demolition of a Wall" by the Lumiere brothers in the same year was recorded as the first film to use special effects when played in reverse. The first comedy film was the Lumiere brothers' "The Sprinkler Sprinkled."
                
                            George Melies, a carpenter and magician among the viewers of these films, was deeply influenced and entered the world of cinema. His film "A Trip to the Moon" in 1902 is considered both the first scripted film and the first science fiction film in cinema history.
                
                            In the same year, footage shot by British inventor Edward Raymond Turner, featuring children playing with a parrot, Japanese fish, and sunflowers, was recorded as the world's first colored cinema film.
                
                            Following this period, the first cinema halls, named Nickelodeon, opened in the U.S. in 1905. In 1906, a 70-minute film titled "The Story of Kelly Gang" was released in Australia, becoming the longest film made until that time.
                
                            Also during the silent cinema era, in 1911, credits were shown at the beginning of films for the first time. The industry gradually shifted to Hollywood, and the 1913 film "The Squaw Man," directed by Oscar Apfel and Cecile B. De Mille, was considered the first Hollywood production.
                
                            Charlie Chaplin, often regarded as the brightest star of the silent cinema era, made his debut in the film "Kid Auto Races at Venice," produced at Keystone Studios in 1914.
                
                            David Llewelyn Wark Griffith, an American director considered the initiator of modern cinematic storytelling, created epic masterpieces during this period, featuring lengthy durations and massive sets.

                            <font color="red"><b><h4>First use of dual-channel sound in cinema with "King Kong"</h4></b><br></font>
                            Following the end of the "Silent Cinema" era with "The Jazz Singer," immediately after, the film "Lights of New York," entirely shot with sound by Warner Bros in 1928, broke the box office record of the time with approximately 1 million dollars in revenue.
                
                            Despite initial resistance to sound cinema, these years, in which a new cinematic concept was questioned, later transformed into the idea that sound was an essential element in completing cinema. In 1933, the film "King Kong" pioneered the use of dual-channel sound, introducing sound design to cinema.
                
                            Along with the sense of realism provided by sound in world cinema, films addressing societal issues emerged, covering various genres among the products of production companies. This included gangster films where urban slang and conflict scenes were realistically depicted, as well as biographical films depicting the lives of famous personalities.
                
                            The increase in audience numbers with sound cinema strengthened the dominance of major companies in the U.S., and during the studio system era from 1930 to 1945, around 7,500 films were produced within the studio system, with production companies specializing in specific styles.
                
                            Internationally, notable developments during this period included the achievements of French cinema with directors such as Rene Clair, Jean Vigo, and Jean Renoir. German cinema, influenced by Hitler's regime, produced propaganda films, such as the works of Leni Riefenstahl.
                
                            Japan, which adapted to sound cinema later, started monopolizing and producing mass films in the film industry.

                            <font color="red"><b><h4>First Turkish cinema was established as "National Cinema" on March 19, 1910</h4></b><br></font>
                            In Turkey, the first screening of a sound film took place on September 25, 1929, at the Elhamra Cinema, one of the most luxurious cinemas of that time, presenting the film "The Woman's Journey to War."
                
                            The introduction of Ottoman Empire to cinema occurred when the film "Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station" by the Lumiere Brothers was shown in 1896 at a tavern in Istanbul's Galatasaray by Sigmund Weinberg, a German Jew.

                            <font color="red"><b><h4>Formation of cinema in Turkey was achieved in 1915</h4></b><br></font>
                            While public cinema screenings were maintained under the dominance of foreign nationals and minorities in Turkey, the first Turkish cinema, named "National Cinema," was established in the Şehzadebaşı district of Istanbul on March 19, 1910.
                
                            The institutionalization of cinema in Turkey took place during World War I. Enver Pasha, who served as the Acting Commander in Chief and Minister of War during that period, witnessed the use of films by the German armies as a propaganda tool and for the training of soldiers. In 1915, he established the Central Army Cinema Department (MOSD), laying the foundations for the institutionalization of Turkish cinema.
                
                            The establishment of MOSD and the narrative films made in the subsequent period became one of the most important developments in the history of cinema. Also during this period, Fuat Uzkınay's documentary "The Destruction of the Russian Monument in Ayastefanos" was considered the first work of Turkish Cinema, and Uzkınay was acknowledged as the first Turkish filmmaker.
                
                            According to various sources, the film depicting the destruction of the Russian monument in Ayastefanos, shown on November 14, 1914, with a length of 150-300 meters, has been regarded as the first work of Turkish cinema, although no copy has survived to this day.
                
                            Some sources attribute the birth of cinema in Turkey to the late 19th century, based on short documentaries by the Ottoman citizens, the Manaki Brothers, depicting life in the Balkans.
